# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

[My Quiz](https://a-thread.github.io/Timed-Code-Quiz/)

The assignment was to create a timed multiple choice quiz that was responsive to multiple screen sizes and had a clean interface.

## My Quiz

I created a simple quiz, matching the example that was given to us. As requested, the timer begins once the user clicks "Start Quiz" and it ends when the timer ends or the user answers all of the questions.

### Responsive Interface

I used Bootstrap to make my screen as responsive as possible to multiple screen sizes. 

### Scoring

As reqested in the prompt, when the user selected a correct answer, 10 seconds is added to the clock and "Right!" is displayed below the next question.

When the user selected a wrong answer, 10 seconds is subtracted from the clock and "Wrong" is displayed below the next question.

The user's final score is determined by the time left on the clock and is displayed on the EndGame screen.

#### High Score Screen

Unfortunately I ran out of time in this homework and wasn't able to finish my code for the High Score page.
